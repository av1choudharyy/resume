	{\begin{newitemize}
        \format{AI-Powered Asset Analysis Pipeline}{Built hybrid OCR + Vision analysis API combining AWS Textract for precision extraction with Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Bedrock) for semantic image understanding. Engineered 3-tier product matching using Amazon Titan V2 embeddings (1024-dim cosine similarity): image OCR vectors, description vectors, and keyword fallback, with LLM-in-the-loop visual verification and confidence scoring. Supports PDF page-level processing, image compression, and pre-signed S3 URL generation.}
        \format{Agentic RAG Platform — ReAct Architecture}{Designed and built enterprise AI platform using LangGraph ReAct agent with 16 dynamically-orchestrated tools. Integrated Claude Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 via AWS Bedrock with cross-region inference profiles. Built multimodal embedding pipeline using Amazon Nova Embed V2 (3072-dim, configurable to 1024/384/256). Implemented HNSW vector index (hnswlib) for sub-millisecond semantic search and Amazon Rerank 1.0 with intelligent skip logic and blended scoring (70\% rerank + 30\% HNSW).}
        \format{Knowledge Bank \& Semantic Caching}{Built self-improving knowledge system that auto-caches every Q\&A pair as vector embeddings for progressive knowledge enrichment — creating a growing semantic knowledge base for future LLM fine-tuning. Implemented knowledge graph interlinking queries, tables, and files with context enrichment pulling frequently-used tables, related files, and table hints. Schema discovery with 24-hour TTL cache and stale embedding invalidation.}
        \format{Multimodal Document Intelligence}{Engineered unified analysis pipeline: image OCR (Textract primary, Claude Vision fallback), PDF page-level extraction with per-page embeddings (PyMuPDF, adaptive DPI), Excel chunked processing (openpyxl), audio transcription (Amazon Transcribe), and video analysis (ffmpeg keyframe extraction + Claude Vision batch frame descriptions). All extracted content stored with full-text search indexing.}
        \format{NL2SQL \& S3 Storage System}{Built natural language to SQL engine with automatic schema discovery, TTL-cached metadata, historical query pattern matching, and 20+ SQL injection pattern blocks. Designed SHA-256 hash-based file deduplication, proxied downloads (zero direct S3 URL exposure), file-session reference tracking, semantic file search via HNSW + reranking, and S3 lifecycle tiering (Standard-IA to Glacier).}
        \format{Session Management \& Collaboration}{Built custom SQL-backed LangGraph checkpoint saver enabling conversation persistence across container restarts. Implemented session forking from any message, token-based sharing with message boundaries, fork chain traversal, access request workflow with push notifications, bookmarks, soft delete preserving fork data, and full-text search across conversations.}
        \format{Enterprise Security — IAM-Style RBAC}{Implemented JWT authentication with refresh rotation, bcrypt hashing, and IAM-style RBAC with JSON policy documents, deny-wins evaluation, role hierarchy, wildcard resource matching, and per-endpoint enforcement across 8 resource groups with 18 admin API endpoints.}
        \format{Sandboxed Code Execution}{Built Python sandbox with subprocess isolation, 120s timeout, and import guard blocking 18 dangerous modules via custom MetaPathFinder. Supports inline Plotly chart rendering via SSE streaming, plus Excel/PDF/PPTX/CSV export generation using pandas, reportlab, and python-pptx.}
        \format{Production Infrastructure}{Deployed FastAPI on AWS Lambda with Docker and SAM. Built 200K-token context window management with LLM summarization, Parquet archival pipeline, audit logging, request tracing, and Expo push notifications. 99 test files across unit, integration, and AWS tests.}
        \format{Cross-Platform Mobile AI Client}{Built React Native/Expo app with real-time SSE streaming chat, AI chain-of-thought visualization, session forking/sharing/bookmarks, RBAC admin panel with IAM policy builder, file management with dependency tracking, deep linking, and push notifications.}
